        "article_text": "HAMILTON \u2013 Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is condemning a former candidate of her party for throwing non-organic pumpkin seeds at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier today.\n\nAccording to the RCMP, the woman who tossed seeds at the Prime Minister in a protest against the LNG pipeline decision had purchased the pumpkin- which contained the seeds- from a local Loblaws instead of a certified organic farm.\n\n\u201cOur party never thinks it\u2019s okay to throw seeds that were grown with the use of pesticides,\u201d explained May at an emergency press conference. \u201cWe strongly condemn any behaviour that doesn\u2019t take into account local farmers. Her actions only reinforces big agribusiness and does not reflect Green Party values.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the RCMP conducted a thorough search of the candidate\u2019s home and seized lentils, quinoa, and a variety of other improvised tossing material.",

        "article_text": "A federal board responsible for protecting Americans against abuses by spy agencies is in disarray just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nThe five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have only two remaining members as of Jan. 7 \u2014 and no Democrats even though it is required to operate as an independent, bipartisan agency.\n\nThe vacancies mean it will lack the minimum three members required to conduct business and can work only on ongoing projects. Trump would have to nominate new members, who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe board was revitalized after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures on the scope of U.S. spying in 2013. It notably concluded that the NSA's phone surveillance program was unconstitutional.",

        "article_text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has given Planned Parenthood final notice of plans to cut off Medicaid funding, a move that federal judges have so far blocked other Republican-controlled states from making. \n\nPlanned Parenthood responded Tuesday by saying it will also ask a court to stop Texas from defunding clinics in January. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kansas are among the states where judges have denied similar efforts.\n\nPeople are donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name\nPlanned Parenthood had previously received $3.1 million in Medicaid funding from the state of Texas, according to the notice that was obtained by the Texas Tribune. Planned Parenthood says its clinics serve nearly 11,000 women in Texas each year through Medicaid. \n\nPlanned Parenthood will lose the Medicaid funding within 30 days. The organization has 15 days to appeal  by requesting an administrative hearing with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, according to the Tribune. \n\nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards responded by calling Texas \u201ca cautionary tale for the rest of the nation.\u201d The move comes at a time when her organization is simultaneously fighting to stop Congress from also cutting off taxpayer dollars. President-elect Donald Trump has given mixed signals about his feelings toward the group.\n\nLast week, the Obama administration barred states from denying federal family planning funds, although abortion opponents immediately said they would seek to repeal it when Mr. Trump takes office in January.
