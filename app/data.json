While anti-Trump groups are urging electors to vote for someone else, electors are expected to ratify the New York businessman's victory in last month's election.\n\nThe president-elect is operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to stay through at least Christmas Day.\n\nAs secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.\n\nIn its announcement, the Trump transition team said Viola is a West Point graduate and he \"will combine a deep background in national security affairs with an impressive track record of leading and managing high-performing teams within the military and the private sector.\"",

What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.\n\n\"Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,\" he said. \"And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.\"\n\nThe same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,\" he said. \"The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.\"\n\nBut Obama also said he's installed \"guardrails\" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.\n\n\"You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that.

Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.\n\nBut the foundation\u2019s inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman\u2019s investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump\u2019s incoming administration.
