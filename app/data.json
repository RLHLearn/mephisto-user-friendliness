        "article_text": "The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include \u201ccyber-operations,\u201d to the alleged Russian interference in last month\u2019s election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials.\n\nThe report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions.\n\nPresident Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. \n\n\u201cI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing,\u201d Mr. Obama told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep earlier this month. \u201cSome of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.\u201d\n\nIntelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges.\n\nIan Bremmer on impact of Russia hack, China drone controversy\nA 2015 executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last-ditch effort within the administration to expand the president\u2019s authority on the matter.\n\nAccording to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president-elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cPart of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,\u201d the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying.\n\nThe announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,\u201d the Post quotes an administration official as saying.\n\n\u201cI am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, \u2018That worked pretty well in 2016, so let\u2019s keep going.\u2019 We have elections every two years in this country.\u201d",

        "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama says he has no regrets about his go-it-alone use of executive power \u2014 even if President-elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies.\n\n\"I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so,\" Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. \"If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process.\"\n\nIn his traditional end-of-year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide-ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency.\n\nObama argued that his use of executive action wasn't much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.\n\n\"Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,\" he said. \"And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.\"\n\nThe same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,\" he said. \"The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.\"\n\nBut Obama also said he's installed \"guardrails\" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.\n\n\"You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney general\u2019s office said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\n\nThe statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.\n\nBut the foundation\u2019s inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman\u2019s investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump\u2019s incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trump\u2019s global business empire during his presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.\n\nPresident-elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation\nThe admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.\n\nThe 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundation\u2019s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.\n\nIn the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesn\u2019t provide details on the violations.\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundation\u2019s purchases.\n\nTrump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.\n\n\u201cThe DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses,\u201d the president-elect tweeted. \u201c100% of the money goes to wonderful charities.\u201d",

        "article_text": "President-elect Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against President Obama on Wednesday, accusing the current president of \u201croadblocks\u201d leading up to Inauguration Day.\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cdoing [his] best to disregard\u201d the \u201cinflammatory \u2026 statements and roadblocks\u201d from Mr. Obama:\n\nMr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. Obama\u2019s comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to \u201cmobilize\u201d Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in 2016.\n\n\u201cI am confident in this vision because I\u2019m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could\u2019ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on Axelrod\u2019s podcast AxeFiles. \u201cI know that in conversations that I\u2019ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.\u201d\n\nThese comments appear to have gotten under Mr. Trump\u2019s skin: Wednesday\u2019s tweet is the third in three days about Mr. Obama.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that there is \u201cNO WAY\u201d Mr. Obama could have defeated him if he had been able to run for a third term this year:\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Obama \u201ccampaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost\u201d:\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Obama seemed to move past the scathing campaign trail rhetoric in the weeks immediately following Election Day, talking by phone on several occasions and speaking in positive terms about their interactions.\n\nIn a meeting with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump described his \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Mr. Obama. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI probably thought that maybe I wouldn\u2019t, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot.\u201d\n\nBut as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. Obama\u2019s recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.\n\nMr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that \u201ceven when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\u201d",
