Palmieri added: \"Her prayers are with the people of Charlotte during these difficult times.\" Donald Trump wasted no time in responding to Clinton's reversal on social media, accusing his opponent of trying to \"grandstand\" and calling her initial decision to go to Charlotte \"dumb.\" \"Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!\" the Republican nominee tweeted late Friday. Trump was reportedly considering traveling to Charlotte next week following the presidential debate Monday, but has not elaborated on those plans. He incorrectly identified Clinton's initial trip as scheduled for Saturday. Protests have erupted in Charlotte since Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday afternoon. The outcry over yet another officer-involved killing of a black person, days after an officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shot and killed Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands up when he was fatally struck, turned violent late Wednesday into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to issue a state of emergency. Earlier Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee called on police to release the video of the shooting ? afterScott family had released its own cellphone video recorded byScott wife, Rakeyia Scott. ?Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides,? she wrote on Twitter, signing her message with ?-H? to denote it came from her, not her campaign.",

Donald Trump tweets. | AP Photo Trump hits Clinton on Islamic State: ?It is time for change? Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies. ?Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,? Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. ?Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.? Story Continued Below Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks. The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words ?radical Islamic terrorism? and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe. ?Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything ? and blame anyone ? to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,? he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are ?hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.? Trump vowed to ?bring an end to these senseless acts of violence? and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a ?narrative fight.? ?They are wrong to say thatwe in a fight about ?narratives,?? Trump said. ?These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.?",

        "question_text": "?I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns butwe going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby.? ? Hillary Clinton on MSNBC, 4/25/16 There are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation, existential kind of national election. These folks notice all of the dangers we face and worry that depending on how the vote falls this November, we may soon be a very different nation thanwe been.I not sure I fit on this worrisome boat, but I do believe that our dearest rights and freedoms are in danger today. The Left has developed a fascist streak unlike anywe seen previously in American history, and they believe it to be their duty to destroy our liberty? for our own good, of course. ?The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.? ? Hillary Clinton, The Free Beacon, 10/1/15 Into this caustic climate comes the NRA, an organization wholly devoted to defending the 2nd Amendment from the gun-grabbing left. The NRA believes that if elected president, Hillary Clinton would do everything in her power to undermine and repeal the 2nd Amendment. Because of this, they are working hard to unmask her as the anti-freedom fascist she really is. Their latest ad paints a disturbing picture, reminding all Americans what is really at stake in the upcoming election. This is the second in the ?Don?t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless? series. The previous ad covered the disgusting hypocrisy ofClinton anti-gun position.Here a woman who has lived the last 30+ years of her life surrounded by men with firearms, yet she has the audacity to tell law abiding American citizens that theyshouldn have the right to use the same tool to defend their families? If itwasn such a serious topic,it be laughable. ?When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns.?? Hillary Clinton, USA Today, 4/20/2016 In November, you can actively defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. All you have to do is vote AGAINST Hillary Clinton.

        "question_text": " The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs. The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria's civil war, for instance -- than what was discussed. To be fair, the debate was not intended to focus on international issues, which were basically a footnote in the \"securing America\" segment. But amid the exchanges about ISIS, Iran, NATO and nuclear proliferation, there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton. Fighting ISIS Trump to Clinton: You're going to stop ISIS? \"I don't think so.\" https://t.co/iXIwDaIPem #DebateNight https://t.co/a0RbNrI174 For the most part, Trump focused on attacking Clinton's record -- \"she's got experience, but it's bad experience\" -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals. That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS, which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate. Clinton spoke of the need to \"intensify our air strikes against ISIS,\" \"support our Arab and Kurdish partners,\" and \"take out their leadership\" -- positions that don't differ much from President Barack Obama's current policies. Clinton on Trump's secret ISIS plan: \"The only secret is that he has no plan\" https://t.co/iXIwDaIPem #DebateNight https://t.co/QdCOetGlUa ? CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 27, 2016 Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton and Obama for contributing to the rise of the terror group by pulling out of Iraq, but he offered no details of his own \"secret\" plan \"to knock the hell out of ISIS.\" When Clinton taunted him about not having a plan, he retorted: \"You're telling the enemy everything you want to do ... No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\" ( Fact check: ISIS only came into being in 2006 after splintering from al Qaeda in Iraq. Clinton was born in 1947.) Iran's nuclear deal JUST WATCHED Iran: The biggest issue for the next US president? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iran: The biggest issue for the next US president? 00:47 Similarly, on Iran, Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for striking \"one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history,\" arguing that Iran had been \"about to fall\" and was now poised to become a \"major power.\" But he didn't offer many suggestions for how it should have been done differently, beyond suggesting that \"they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\" Support for NATO Donald Trump discusses his position on NATO and working with them to defeat ISIS #debates https://t.co/wLpLXusVKP ? PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) September 27, 2016 If the debate didn't offer much new insight into Trump's foreign policy plans, his comments about America's allies and NATO certainly did. \"I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world ... where they're not paying us what we need,\" Trump said. JUST WATCHED Fact check: Was Russia behind the DNC cyberattacks? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fact check: Was Russia behind the DNC cyberattacks? 01:27 It was a moment that will have sent shudders down the spines of America's international allies -- an isolationist vision that has many global leaders wary about a President Trump. Already under Obama, there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role, particularly in the Middle East. Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different, saying: \"we've got to work more closely with our allies\". But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely, the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor. Perhaps the next debate will offer some more clues.",

        "question_text": "?I?ve never seen anything like this.He the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.? ? A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become the Republican version of Barack Obama. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York. For his efforts he was attacked, criticized, and derided by liberals and their partners in the media. As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D-NY) refused to call the terrorism what it was, Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his ?rhetoric.? Arguing that by talking tough, Mr. Trump was somehow giving ?aid and comfort to the enemy.? ?Idon want to speculate buthere what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,? Clinton said. ?We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.? In fact, the left, almost as one, decriedTrump comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks. However, most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump, and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize thatTrump early comments were correct. Wedon yet know how theweekend events will play into the upcoming election, but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic. Fundraising for example. Donald Trump has already, with 7 weeks left before Election Day, outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among ?small donors.? Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $200 or less to his campaign ? in less than three months.Trump campaign has surpassed a ?threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign,? according to Politico, which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with thecampaign fundraising efforts. All of this also shows what could be a building Trump tsunami? Read the Rest of the Story at the Daily Surge?",

        "question_text": "?Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people.? ?Dan Stein, President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), they have charged that the Obama administration ?grossly misrepresented ? by almost tenfold? the number of crimes that were committed by illegal, criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014. Now, if the term ?illegal, criminal aliens? sounds like overkill, understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally, which makes them criminals. However, applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated, but not deported. ?In response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015, ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released, instead of deported, in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses,? readFAIR press release. ?However, the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) onFAIR behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288. It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions. Thus, the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater.? ?The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported underICE self-declared prioritiesfor removal,? the press release added. ?The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes: homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, drunk driving, and other offenses. Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes, ICE doubled down in FY2015 nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals.? ?In recent years, the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted, despite ample funds to remove many more. As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegalalienscriminals the safety of the American public, thousands of people have been needlessly victimized,? charged Dan Stein, president of FAIR. ?Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people,? added Stein. ?Moreover, despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing, DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police.? ?Congress has to act. It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain,? Stein concluded. In March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security. They were not deported. In fact, so-called ?sanctuary cities? released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported, but never were. In 2014, it was also reported the administration released 75% of illegals rather than deport them. It appears to me that DHS needs to be renamed the Department of Homeland IN-Security.

        "question_text": " During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because ?hewould gotten it, if I wanted it.? But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul ? this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports: One of these stories is alie detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads toTrump mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when hedoesn want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even thoughBush story reinforced what Trump was saying atrallies had played the ?cash for outcomes? political game foryears could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless ofBushopposition Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bushwould full well known, as would have Trump. Because afterTrumpna attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure.Eichenwald point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if hehadn been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony issimple wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater scandalfor half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlikeTrump other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and hisparty base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth onit head.Trump penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, butit a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President. See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald,there no third option here: Bush: ?The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views onsomething was generous and gave memoney Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.? Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: Ididn? Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and youdidn get it, because I was opposed to? Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before? Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after.I not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition: A lawyer asked Trump, ?Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?? Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-ElectBush I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida,didn you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But youdidn change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon ? thank you! ? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016What curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from ? which will come as quite a surprise: Data is from Trendsmap.comThat right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advancePutin agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya.It a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow.Putin trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: ?humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.?
